    <p>I love JDM cars, which are vehicles specifically made for the Japanese domestic market, earning the name "JDM".</p>
    <p>Some key feature of JDM cars are that they are all right hand drive as that is what they do in Japan </p>
    <p>My Dad and I both share this passion, we now have 3 JDM cars, a Mitsubishi Pajero, Toyota Prado, and Suzuki Carry</p>
